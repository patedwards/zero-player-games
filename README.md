## Development log

### 0.1 run a few basic sims with a Ravenoid predator

Run `python -m runners.simple_boids_runner` to see a simulation with some basic flocking.

It's cool to see the Ravenoid 'chase' and the boids 'dodge' without any influence but some simple rules.

Run ` python -m runners.random_agent_runner` to see some simple random walking.
